# Shadowfox Internship

Welcome to my internship portfolio at Shadowfox, where I worked as a Java Developer. During this internship, I was assigned tasks at three different levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level included two projects that helped me enhance my skills and gain practical experience in Java development.

## Task Level: Beginner

### 1. Simple Contact Management System
- **Description**: Created a simple command-line contact management system using Java. The system allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts. Contact information such as name, phone number, and email address is stored in memory.
- **Key Learning**: Basic CRUD operations, user input/output, array or ArrayList data structures.

### 2. Student Information System with GUI (JavaFX/Swing)
- **Description**: Developed a Student Information System with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing. The system allows users to add, display, update, and delete student records visually.
